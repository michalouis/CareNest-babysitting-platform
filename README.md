This project was developed as part of the final assignment for the Human-Computer Interaction (ΥΣ08) course at the Department of Informatics, Kapodistrian University of Athens. The assignment involved redesigning and modernizing an outdated website provided by the Greek government, which aimed to connect parents seeking childcare with experienced nannies. Our primary focus was on improving the user interaction and accessibility of the platform, ensuring that both parents and nannies could navigate the website effortlessly and complete their tasks efficiently. By analyzing the original website's shortcomings, we implemented a user-centered design approach to create a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.

The front end was developed with React, leveraging Google's Material UI library to create responsive and accessible components. For the back end, we utilized Firebase to handle user authentication, real-time database interactions, and secure data storage. This combination of technologies allowed us to deliver a seamless and dynamic user experience while maintaining a scalable and reliable infrastructure. The result is a platform that not only simplifies the process of finding and hiring nannies but also ensures transparency and trust between users.
